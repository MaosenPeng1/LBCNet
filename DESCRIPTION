Description: This package provides functions to estimate propensity scores using 
    the Local Balance with Calibration implemented by Neural Networks (LBC-Net), 
    proposed by Peng et al. (2025). LBC-Net integrates deep learning models 
    to enhance covariate balance based on a newly developed theoretical framework for 
    defining propensity scores. Additionally, the package provides tools for evaluating 
    estimation performance, including local balance and calibration checks.

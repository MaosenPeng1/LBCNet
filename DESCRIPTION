Description: Implements the Local Balance Calibration Network (LBC-Net), a deep learning approach for 
  nonparametric propensity score estimation that optimizes covariate balance through local balance and 
  calibration conditions. The package provides tools for treatment effect estimation, variance estimation via 
  influence-function methods, and support for survival estimands such as risk and survival differences. It 
  also includes diagnostics for assessing estimation performance, including local balance and calibration 
  checks.

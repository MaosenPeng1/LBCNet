\title{Mirror Histogram of Propensity Scores}
\usage{
mirror_hist(
  object = NULL,
  ps = NULL,
  Tr = NULL,
  bins = 70,
  size = 0.5,
  theme.size = 15,
  grid = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An optional object of class `lbc_net`. If provided, extracts `ps` (fitted propensity scores)
and `Tr` (treatment assignment).}

\item{ps}{A numeric vector of propensity scores. Required if `object` is not provided.}

\item{Tr}{A binary numeric vector indicating treatment assignment (1 for treatment, 0 for control).
Required if `object` is not provided.}

\item{bins}{Integer specifying the number of bins in the histogram. Default is 70.}

\item{size}{Numeric specifying the line size for the histogram bars. Default is 0.5.}

\item{theme.size}{Numeric specifying the base font size for the theme. Default is `15`.}

\item{grid}{Logical indicating whether to include gridlines in the plot background. Default is `TRUE`.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to `ggplot2` layers for customization.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object for further customization or direct display.
}
\description{
Creates a mirror histogram to compare the distribution of propensity scores
between treated and control groups introduced by Li and Greene (2013).
}
\details{
This function creates a mirror histogram where the control group (Z=0) is displayed above the x-axis
and the treatment group (Z=1) is displayed below the x-axis, making it easier to compare the distribution of
propensity scores across groups.
}
\examples{
# Example with manually provided propensity scores and treatment indicators
set.seed(123)
ps <- runif(10000)  # Simulated propensity scores
Tr <- sample(0:1, 10000, replace = TRUE)  # Random treatment assignment
mirror_hist(ps = ps, Tr = Tr, bins = 50, size = 0.8)

\dontrun{
# Example with an `lbc_net` object
model <- lbc_net(data = data, formula = Tr ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4)
mirror_hist(model)
}

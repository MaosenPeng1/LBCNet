\title{Summary of an lbc_net Object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{lbc_net}(object, Y = NULL, type = "ATE", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class `"lbc_net"`, generated by `lbc_net()`.}

\item{Y}{(Optional) A numeric vector of observed outcomes. If the model
was originally fitted with an outcome `Y` inside \code{\link{lbc_net}}
and already contains a stored treatment effect (and variance), this
argument is ignored and the stored results are reported. If no treatment
effect is stored in `object` and `Y` is supplied, a point estimate is
computed via \code{\link{est_effect}} without a variance estimate.}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the treatment effect to estimate
when using \code{\link{est_effect}}. Options:
- `"Y"`: Computes the weighted mean outcome.
- `"ATE"` (default): Computes the Average Treatment Effect.
- `"ATT"`: Computes the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated.
If the model already stores a treatment effect (from a call to
\code{lbc_net(..., Y = ..., estimand = ...)}), the stored type is used
instead of this argument.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (ignored).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{\code{sample_info}}{Sample sizes and covariate counts.}
  \item{\code{losses}}{Training losses.}
  \item{\code{local_balance}}{Local standardized differences from training.}
  \item{\code{balance_table}}{Pre- and post-weighting global standardized differences (GSD).}
  \item{\code{treatment_effect}}{Estimated treatment effect and, when available,
    its standard error and confidence interval.}
  \item{\code{gsd}}{GSD after weighting.}
}
}
\description{
Provides a structured summary of an `lbc_net` object,
including loss values, balance assessments, and (if available) a treatment
effect estimate with standard error and confidence interval.
}
\details{
The function extracts key model components using \code{\link{getLBC}}.
If the fitted object contains a stored treatment effect (e.g., from a call
to \code{lbc_net(..., Y = ..., estimand = ..., compute_variance = TRUE)}),
\code{summary.lbc_net} reports that estimate together with its standard
error and 95\% confidence interval.

If no treatment effect is stored and `Y` is supplied, \code{est_effect}
is used to compute a point estimate only (no variance). If neither is
available, the summary focuses on balance diagnostics.

It is designed for estimating causal effects in settings with continuous or
binary outcomes. For survival outcomes, users should apply appropriate
survival analysis models, such as a weighted Cox model or other
time-to-event estimation methods.
